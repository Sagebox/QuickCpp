About Sandbox Examples
----------------------

Sagebox Quick C++ has a "Sandbox" project mode, where the Sagebox Quick C++ environment is
created for you, with certain options turned on, such as the Process Window, Control-C exits, and
so-forth. 

The examples in this directory show a few examples of using the Sandbox mode.  For the most part, these
examples are almost exactly the same as their counterparts in the other example directories, except that have
no setup code or exit code. 

The main idea with the Sandbox is that you can enter a programming environment without setting up Sagebox
Quick C++ in a safe, friendly environment for programming general C/C++. 

There is also no need exit code, and you don't have to worry about the program closing down prematurely. 

The main Sandbox mode merges the Sagebox Window with stdio functions and has no Console Mode Window.
