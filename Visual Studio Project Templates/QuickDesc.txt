Quick Description of Templates
------------------------------

The Main template to use is "Console Mode (and Windows)", which provides Console Mode and Pure Windows templates for 
using Sagebox.   The Windows version is a project setting that also links with WinMain.lib() so that WinMain() calls your
main(). 

--> Console Mode (and Windows)

Creates a standard C++ Console Mode (or Windows C++) starting at main().  The template adds code to start the
Sagebox Quick C++ environment, and adds code to print out Hello World and a circle on the Sagebox Window. 

This template has a "Windows" project setting, turning the program into a Pure Windows program.  It links
with WinMain.lib to transfer control from WinMain() to main(). 

This allows the program to switch back-and-forth between a Console Mode program and Windows program with
no code changes.

--> Windows

This is a Windows version of the Sagebox Quick C++ template starting at WinMain().  It prints "Hello World"
messages to the window and draws a circle. 

It also adds an ExitButton() at the end, since it is a Windows program with no console mode.


--> Sandbox 

The Sandbox Template is a Pure Windows program that automatically creates the Sagebox Quick C++ environment. 

The program starts at main(), printing out "Hello World" messages and draws a circle.

This program does not start Sagebox Quick C++ or have any exit code.  This is done automatically. 

As a Sandbox version, it also creates the Process Control Window as visible and turns on Control-C to exit the
program easily.
